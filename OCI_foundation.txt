-------------------------------------------------
https://blogs.oracle.com/cloud-infrastructure/creating-a-secure-connection-between-oracle-cloud-infrastructure-and-other-cloud-providers



Getting Started  with OCI : - 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  OCI Global Footprint : 
	Nov-19 : 16 Region - 11 Commercial Region & 5 Government Region  
		 20 Planned -17 Commercial Region & 3 Government Region  

  Inside AD : 
	Non-oversubscribed network , no noisy neighbors
	Very high scale - 1 million network port in an AD
	Predictable low latency and high speed interconnect between host in an AD

  Off Box Network Virtualization : 
	Virtual Network
	
  Differentiation :
	Technical 						Business
	  Perforamce						Aggressive and Predictable pricing
		off box nework virtualization 			SAL Performance Availability and Management
		Bare Metal + Local NVMe				BYOL & Universal Cloud Credit
		All SSD Storage					Support through one Org
		No Network/CPU/Memory over-subscription
	Battle Tested
	DB Options - BM VM RAC Exadata
	Enterprise App Support (EBS JDE)


Identity & Access Management : - 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  IAM :  (Users, Group, Dynamic Group,Policies, Compartment, Federation, Authentication Setting )
            |
           MFA , API Keys, Auth Token

	Group of users  > Policy (Permission)   > Resources

	Group of Users
		What type of access
		Which specific resources
        Resource - Oracle Cloud object like Compute , Instance, Block Storage , VCN
	Each OCI resource has a unique identifier called as Oracle Cloud ID ( OCID )
	IAM uses tradaitional identity concepts such as Principal , USers , Group , AuthN, AuthZ Compartment
	User enforce security principles of least privileges (user > group > policy)
 	Same user can be member of mulitple group
	Principal - IAM identity that is allowed to interact with OCI Resources   1) IAM Users (Individual Users or Applictions) 2) Instance Principal
	First IAM User is default Admin, Default ADmin setup other IAM Usrs and group	
	Users has no permission until placed in group and that group has atleast one policy with permssion on compartment or tenancy
	Instance Principal - let instance to make API Call to other OCI services removing need to configure user credentails or a configuration file 
	
  Authentication :
	Username and Password - 
	API Signing Key - Required when using OCI API in conjunction with SDK/CLI
			  Key is an RSA key pair in PEM format (2048 bit)
			  In OCI console you copy paste content of PEM Public file ,Use private key with SDK or own client to sign your API Request
	Auth Token -      Oracle generated token strng to authenticate third party API that do not support OCI signature-based auth. (ADW)
			  Auth tokens do not expire

  Authorization : 
	Policy cannot be attached to Users only to Group
	Allow group <group name> to <verb> <resource> in tenancy / compartment [where condition]
	Everthing denied by default
	Policy attachment
	Policy inheritence

IAM Policies : 	
  Policy Syntax : 
	Policy need to be attach to tenancy or compartment, You cannot leave it like this
	Allow group <group name> to <verb> <resource> in tenancy / compartment [where condition]
	Verbs  >  Permission > API Operation
	Verbs - 
		Inspect - List resource
		Read - Inspect + Ability to get user define metadata
		Use - Read + Update (ability to work with resource)
		Manage - Include all premission for the resource
	
	Resource Type - 
		Aggregate Resource type 		Individual Resource type
			all-resource			
			database-family
			instance-family
			cluster-family
			object-family
			file-family
			volumne-famiily
			virtual-network-family
			dns 
			Tag-namespace
  Common Policies  :
	Allow group NetworkAdmin to manage virtual-network-family in tenancy 

	Allow group InstanceAdmin to manage instance-family in compartment ABC
	Allow group InstanceAdmin to read app-catalog-listing in tenancy
	Allow group InstanceAdmin to use volumne-family in compartment ABC
	Allow group InstanceAdmin to use virtual-network-family in compartment XYZ

  Advance Policy Syntax  :
	Allow group <group name> to <verb> <resource> in tenancy / compartment where condition
	You use variables when adding condition to a policy 
		Request - relevant to request itself
		Target -  relevant to resource being acted upon in the request 	
		request.operation ||  target.group.name	
	Allow group phooenix_admin to manage all-resources in tenancy where request.region='phx'
	
  IAM-Compartments  : 
	Each resource belong to single compartment, But resource can be connected and shared across compartment (VCN and subnet can live in different comp.)
	Compartment can be delete or renamed
	Most resource can be moved to different compartment
	When you create a policy you need to specify which compartment to attach
	Sub compartment inheart access permission from higher compartment up its hierarchy
	Ater create compartment you need to write at least one policy for it.
 	Compartment can have sub compartments that can be upto six levels deep

  Root Compartment  : 
	Root Compartment > Default Administrator > Group Administrators > allow group Administrators to manage all-resources in tenancy  
		Group Admin cannot be deleted and should have atleast one user in it.

  Compartment Quotas  : 
	Compartment Quotas are similar to Service limits. Biggest difference is that service limit are set by Oracle and Compartment Quotas are 
	set by Administrator using policies
		Three type of quotas policies
			Set - Set maximum number of a cloud resource that can be used in compartment
			Unset - Reset quotas to default service limits
			Zero - removes access to cloud resource for a compartment
	zero compute quotas /*bm*/ in tenancy
	set  compute quotas /*bm*/ to 5 in tenancy where request.region =us-phoenix-1
	 
  Governence > Compartment Explorer 

  Policy Inheritence  : 
	Compartment inherits any policies from their parent compartment
	Three level of compartment A B C
	Policies that apply to resources in Compartment A also apply to resources in Compartment B & C
	Allow group NetworkADmin to manage virtual-network-family in compartment A > allows NetworkADmin to manage VCN in comparment A B & C
 
 Policy Attachment  :
	Concept of attachment when you create a policy you much attach it to a compartment, Where you attach it controls who can then modify it or delete it
	You want to create a policy to allow NetworkAdmin to manage VCN in Compartment C Attach to
		C or B - Allow group NetworkADmin to manage virtual-network-family in compartment C
		A - Allow group NetworkADmin to manage virtual-network-family in compartment B:C
		Tenacy - Allow group NetworkADmin to manage virtual-network-family in compartment A:B:C
 	
  Moving a Compartment to a Different Parent Compartment  : 
	You can move compartment to a different parent compartment with same tenancy
	When you move a compartment all its contents are moved with it.
	Restriction - Two compartment within same parent cannot have same name
		
  Policy implication when moving compartments  : 
	
  IAM Tags  :  (Goverence > Tag Namespace)
	Free form Tags - Consist of Key and Value 
		Eg. Environment = Production
		    Project = Alpha
	Define Tags - More feature and Controls
		Are contained in Tag Namespace
		Define schema, secured with policy
		Eg.Namespace = Operation
		   Tag Key = Environment
		   Value type = String
	Tag Namespace is a container for set of tag keys and tag key definition
	Tag key defination specifies it key env and what type of vlaues are allowed
	Eg : 
		Namespace defination = Opertion
			key defination = Environment

				Tag : 
		 Opertion.Environment="Production"
		Namespace	Key      Value		
	Tag key defination and Tag namespace cannot be deleted but retired
	You can reactivate tag namespace tag key definiation
	Tag namespace and Tag key defination must be setup in your tenance before users can apply 
	You can use varibles to set value of a tag or list of tag key value.
		Operation.CostCenter = ${iam.pricipal.name} a ${oci.datetime}

  Defined Tags work with Policies  : 
	Allow group InstanceLauncher to manage instance-family in compartment A
	Allow group InstanceLauncher to use volumn-family in compartment A
	Allow group InstanceLauncher to use  virtual-network-family in compartment A
	
	Allow group InstanceLauncher to use tag-namespace in compartment A where target.tag-namespace.name='Operation'
		Namespace example

Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) : - 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	CIDR
	VCN
	IP Address
	Gateway & Routing 
	Peering 
	Transit Routing 
	Security
	Putting it all togther

  CIDR Basic :
	<Network><Host>
	<Network><Subnet><Host>
	192.168.1.0/24 (turn network bit to 1)>  192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255
	128,64,32,16,8,4,2,1  > 2^7,2^6,2^5,2^4,2^3,2^2,2^1,2^0
	192 is represented as    1   1	 0   0   0   0   0   0
	168 is represented as    1   0	 1   0   1   0   0   0

	Logical AND     1   1

  Introducion VCN : 
 	A private network that you setup in OCI with firewall and specific gateway
  	A VCN covers a single contiguous IPv4 CIDR block of your choice 
 	A VCN reside in within a single region.
  	Avoid IP range that overlap with other on-prim or other cloud network
  	Use private IP address range specified in RFC 1928 - 10.0.0.0/8  172.16/12 192.168/16 
  	Allowable OCI VNC size range is from /16 to /30
	192.168.1.0 First IP is network IP and cannot be used 192.168.1.255 Last IP is broadcast IP and cannot be used
 	VNC reserves the first two IP address and the last one in each subnet CIDR
 	Each VNC network subdivided in to subnets
	Each subnet can be AD specific or Regional (recommanded)
	AD specific is contained within a single AD in a multi AD region
	Regional subnet spans all three AD in an multi AD region
 	Subnet can be designated as either
		Private - private ip address assign to VNIC
		Public - contain both public and priavte assigned to VNIC

 	Default VCN has - 3 Subnet , 1 IG , Route Table , 1 Security List ,1 DHCP Option 
	192.168.1.0/24 
	192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.255 
	192.168.1.0/27 - Public 
	192.168.1.32/27 - Private 
	
	10.0.0.0/16  >  10.0.1.0/24 10.0.2.0/24  10.0.3.0/24
	Class A /8
	Class B /16
	Class C /24

  IP Address :
	Each instance in a subnet has at least one primary private IP addr
  	Instane >= 2 VNICs addtional VNICs called secondary VNICs
  	Each VNICs has one primary private IP  can have additonal private IPs called Secondary Private IP upto 31 Secondary Private IPs
  	You can have 31 additional priavte IPs
  	A Private IP can have optional Public IP assigned to it.
  	Public IP is IPv4 address which is reachable from internet
	Possible to assign a given resource multiple public ip across one or more VNICs
  	Public IP Address Type -
		Ephemeral - Temporary and existing for the lifetime of the instance 
		Reserved - Persistence and exist beyond the lifetime of instance can be reassigned to new instance
  	 Ephemeral IP can be assigned to Primary Private IP only (Hence only 1 per VNIC vs max 32 for reserved IP) 
 	 No charge for using Public IP 
 	 Oracle Provide cannot choose / edit but can view
		OCI Public Load Balancer , Nat Gateway , DRG-IPSec Tunnels , OKE Master/Worker
  	 Oracle Provide cannot choose / edit  / view
		Internet Gateway , Autonomous Database

  Routing & Gateways : 
	Each subnet uses a single route table specified at time of subnet creation but can be edit later
	Contains rules abt how IP packets can tarvel to different IP address out of the VCN.
	Consist of Route Rules ; Each rules specifies 
		Destination CIDR block 
		Route Target (the next hop) for the traffic that matches that CIDR
	Route table is used only if the destination IP addr is not within VCN CIDR block
	No route table to enable taffice within VCN
	When you add an Internet Gateway, NAT Gateway, DRG, Service gateway, Peering Gateway connection you must update route table for 
	any subnet that uses gateway or conections

      Internet Gateway - 
	IG provide path for network traffic between your VCN and internet
	You can have only one 1 IG for a VCN
	After you add IG you need to add rule to Route Table which says packet to 0.0.0.0/0 (Any IP) need to go to internet gateway

      NAT Gateway -
	NAT gateway gives entire private network access to internet without assiging each host a public IP
	You can have more than one 1 NAT Gateway on a VCN. though a given subnet can route traffic to only a single NAT Gateway
  
     Service Gateway - 
	Service Gateway lets resouce in VCN access public OCI Service such as Object Storage but without using an Internet Gateway of NAT Gateway
 	Service CIDR Labels represent all the public CIDRs for a given ORacle Servic or a group of ORacle Service Eg.
		OCI <region> Object Storage
		All <region> Services

     Dynamic Routing Gateway -
	A virtual router that provide path for private traffic between VCN and distination other than internet
	On-prim network via IPSec VPN (Site to Site VPN) , FastConnect
	DRG is a standalone object. VCN and DRG have 1:1 relationship		 		

  Stateful vs Stateless : Stateful means if the traffic is comming to Port 80 in it remember the state tarffic will always be allowed out from Port 80 

  Peering  : 
    VCN Peering is process of connecting multiple VCN
    Local Peering (Within Region) -
	Local VCN Peering is the process of connecting two VCN in the same regions
	
	Local PeeringGateway is a component on a VCN for routing traffic to a locally peered VCN
	Once  Local PeeringGateway is created in both VCN you need to establish connectivity between Local PeeringGateway 
	Two VCN in the peering relationship shouldnt have overlapping CIDR
 	Peering is non Transtive

    Remote Peering (Across Region) -
	Remote VCN Peering is process of connecting two VCN in different Region
	Requires remote peering connection (RPC) to be created on the DRG. RPC job is to act as a connction point for a remotely peered VCN	
	Two VCN in the peering relationship shouldnt have overlapping CIDR
 	Peering is non Transtive

  Security VCN  : 
    Security List -
	A common set of firewall rules associated with a subnet and applied to all instance launched inside the subnet
	SL consist of rules that specify the type of traffic allowed in and out of subnet
	Associate subnet with SL during creation or later
	You can choose whether a given rule is stateful or stateless 	 
	Security list apply to instance whether its talking to with another instance in the VCN or a host outside of VCN         	

    Network Security Group (NSG) -
	NSG consists of set of rules that apply only to a set of VNICs of your choice in a single VCN
	Currently compute, load balancer & db instance support NSG
	When writing rules for an NSG you can specify NSG as the source or destination
	Oracle recommand to use NSG instead of SL
	You need to attach NSG Manully to VNICs

    SL + NSG -
	You can use SL alone , NSG use alone, Both Together	
	If you choose to use both SL + NSG the set of rules that applies to a given VNIC is the union of these items.
	A Packet is allowed if any rule in any of the relevant list and groups allow the traffic
	
    Stateful Security Rule -
	Default SL rules are stateful	
	Connection tracking when instance receive traffic matching stateful ingress rule the response is tracked
	and egress is allowed automatically without any egress rule

    Stateless Security Rule -
	With stateless rules response traffic is not automatically allow
	To allow the response traffic for a stateless ingress rule you must create a corresponding stateless egress rule
	If you add stateless rules in SL that means you do not want to use Connection Tracking for any traffic that match rules
	Stateless rules are better for scenarious with large numbers of connections (Load balancer Big Data)

 Default VCN & DNS :
    Default VCN Components -
	You VNC automatically comes with some default components
		Default Route Table 
		Default Security List
		Default set of DHCP options
	You cannot delete this default components but you can change their components

    Internal DNS -
	VCN Private DNS enables to use hostname instead of IP address to talk to each other
	Options -
		Internet and VCN Resolver - Default choice for new VCN
		Custom Resolver -  let instances resolve the hostname of host in your on-prim network through IPSec VPN/ Fast Connect
	Optionally specify a DNS Label when creating VCN/Subnet/instance
		VCN : <VCN DNS Label>.oraclevcn.com
		Subnet : <subnet DNS Lable>.<VCN DNS Label>.oraclevcn.com
		Instance FQDN : <hostname>.<subnet DNS Lable>.<VCN DNS Label>.oraclevcn.com
	Instance FQDN resolve to Instane private IP Address
	No automatic creation of FQDN for Public IP address (Eg. cannot ssh using <hostname>.<subnet DNS Lable>.<VCN DNS Label>.oraclevcn.com)
   
  Putting it all Together :
	Subnet can have one route table and multiple (5*) SL assoicated with it.
	Route table defines what can be routed out of VCN
	Private subnet are recommanded to have Individual Route Table
	Instance connont communicate with other instance in same subnet until you permit them to 


Connectivity VPN & FastConnect : - 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
  Connectivity to On-Prim Networks :
    Connectivity Options -
	Public Internet -
		Internet Gateway / NAT Gateway

	Tunnel -
	Authentication -
	Encryption -
	Static Routing -Configure a Router to send traffic for a particular destination in preconfigured direction
	Dynamic Routing - Use a routing protocol such as BGP to figure out what path traffic should take	
	IPSec has two mode
		Transport mode - 
		Tunnel Mode - OCI support only Tunnel Mode not Transport mode

    Dynamic Routing Gateway - 
	A Virtual Router that provide path private traffic between your VPC destination other than internet
	You can use it to established a connection with your on-prim network via IPSec VPN or FastConnect
	DRG is standalone object and must be attached to VCN 
	DRG and VNC has 1:1 relationship
   
    VPN Connect IPSec - 
	VPN Connect is managed VPN Service which securely connect on-prim network to OCI VCN through an IPSec VPN conection
   	VPN connect is free 	
	OCI Provision redundant VPN tunnels located on physically and logically isolated tunnel endpoints
   
    VPN Connect (IPSEC ) - Workflow - 
	CPE Object - (Customer Premises Equipment) virutal representation of on prim network which terminate IPSec Tunnel it could be router firewall Virtual Appliance
	Static Route / Dynamic Route
	DRG (Dynamic Routing Gateway) & Route Table 

	Create a VCN
	Create DRG
	Attach DRG to VCN
	Updated VCN Route Table to route traffic to DRG
	Create CPE object and add on-prim router public ip addr
	From DRG, Create IPSec connection between CPE and DRG and provide static route or use dynamic route (BGP)
	Configure onprim CPE Router


  VPN Connect Demo :
	Create VCN with one subnet 
	Open Certain Ports in VCN in Security List
		Ingress  Source 0.0.0.0/0   TCP - 4500
		Ingress  Source 0.0.0.0/0   TCP - 500
		Ingress  Source 0.0.0.0/0   UDP - 4500
		Ingress  Source 0.0.0.0/0   UDP - 500
	Create Dynamic Routing Gateway
	Create CPE - Virtual Representation of your actual on-premise equipment network device running on your on-prim evn. 
		CPE Required Public IP of on prim 
	Attach DRG to VCN
	Updated Route table
	Create IPSec connection (Tunnel generate public ip) - Require DRG | CPE | CIDR  of onprim | Static Routing (You can choose Dynamic as well)
	On On-Prim Side (LibreSwan VM) - 		
		cat ipsec.conf > Update IPSec tunnel public ip , CIDR in ipsec.conf 
		cat ipsec.secrets > Update IPSec tunnel public ip | CPE Public IP | Shared Secret
	Command : ipsec verify
	Command : sudo service ipsec restart
	Command : sudo ipsec auto --status |grep "=="

  Fast Connect :
	Connect to OCI directly or via pre-integrated Network Partners

	Extend remote datacenter into oracle VCN (Private peering) or connect to Public resources (Public Peering )
	Connection to Oracle Co-location in Data Center (BGP)
	Connection with Oracle Through Oracle Provider (Megaport AT&T Layer 2 or 3  connectvitiy depends upon provider)
     
     Virtual Circut - 
	Isolated network path that runs over one or more physical network connection to provide a single,logical connection between 
	customer edges router and their DRG
	Fastconnect use BGP to exchange routing information and work on Layer 2 ot Layer 3 connectvitiy
     
     FastConnect Use Scenarios -
	Private Peering -
		Extension of the on prim network to the OCI VCN
		Communication across conection with PRivate IP address and use DRG
	Public Peering -
		To access public OCI service such as Object Storage, OCI Console or API over dedicated FastConnection Connection 
		Doesnt use DRG 

  FastConnect Demo : Provider Name , Customer BGP IP Address (CIDR) ,  Oracle BGP IP Address , Customer BGP ASN (Autonomous System Number)
			Copy OCID and provide to Vendor (MegaPort) to provivsion Virtual Circut from their end 





Load Balancer : - 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Load Balancer Intro :
	Load balancer sit between client and backend perform tasks such as
		Service Discovery - Which backends are available
		Health Check - Which backend are health and availble to accept connection
		Algorithm - Which algorith should be used to balance requests 
	Benefits
		Fault Tolerance and HA -
		Scale -
		Name Abstraction - Name resolution can be delegated to LB, Backend dont need to have public IP 

     OCI LB Service - 
	Load Balancer as a service provide Scale and HA
	Public and Private LB Option
	Supported Protocols - TCP, HTTP V1.0, HTTP V1.1 ,HTTP V2, WebSocket
	Support SSL Termination, End-To-End SSL, SSL Tunneling 
	Support advance feature such as session persistence, content based routing 
	Single LB for TCP (Layer 4) and HTTP (Layer 7) traffic
	Provisioned Bandwidth - 100Mbps 400Mbps 8Gbps
	No need to prewarm your load balancer	

     Public LB - 
	Recommandation : For Public LB use Regional Subnet
	Accept traffic from internet using public IP that serve as the entry point for incoming traffic
	Public LB is regional service
	If region has multi AD then Public LB require regional subnet or 2 AD specific subnet each in seperate AD
	LB Service create Primary LB and Secondary LB in each different AD
	Support AD failover
	Floating Public IP is attached to the Primary LB, In case of disaster  Floating Public IP get attached to Standby LB 
	Service treat two load balancer as equivalent and you cannot denote one as Primary
	
	Listener - Entity that check for incoming traffic on the LB IP address
	Backend Server - Application Server responsible for generating content in reply to the incoming TCP or HTTP traffic
	Load Balancing Policy - How to distribute incoming traffic to the backend Servers 
		Round Robin - Default 
		Hash IP - Ensure request from Particular client are always directed to same backend Serer 
		Least Connection -
	Backend Set - Logical entity defined by a list of Backend Servers LB Policy and a Health Check Policy
	Health Check Policy - Confirm availability of backend Servers support
		TCP Level Health Check
		Http Level Health Check 

     Load Balancing Policy - 
	Round Robin - default Policy
	IP Hash - Redirect connection to same backend Server
	Least Connection - Route incoming non-sticky request traffic to fewest connection backend server 
	LB policy decision apply differently to TCP Load Balancer, Cookies based Session Persistence HTTP request (Sticky Requests)
	and Non-Sticky HTTP request
		A TCP LB consider policy and weight criteria
		AM HTTP LB cookies based session persistence forwards rqeuest using cookies sesion info
		For non sticky http request LB apply polices and weight criteria

     Health Check - 
	Health check is test to confirm availability of Backend Servers, Health Check is activated for 	
		Backend Server
		Backend Set
		Overall LB
	LB IP can have upto 16 Listeners (Port 80,443) , And Each listener has backend set that can have upto 1 to N backend Servers
	Health API provide a 4-state health status - OK, Warning Critical Unknow
	Health Status is updated every 3 min	 
	Backup Server Drain State - LB Stop sending new connection good scenario for maintenance 
	Backup Server Offline State - On ingress traffic
	Backup Server Backup State -  LB send traffic to backup server only when all other backend server fail health check



  Public - Load Balancer Demo :

  Private Load Balancer :
	Assigned Private IP addr from the subnet hosting the load balancer
	Load Balancer can be regional or AD-Specific depending upon scope of host subnet
	Load Balancer is accessible only from the VCN that contain assocated subnet
	Private LB with AD specific, Standby LB get created in same AD as of Primary LB


Compute : -  
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Compute Intro :
	BM - Performance Intensive, Workload not virtualized, Need speific Hypervisor, BYOL
	Dediated Virtual Host
	Virtual Machine 
	AMD EPYC BM Server are 66% cheaper than other option (E)

  Image : Oracle Provided Images , Custom Image  , BYOI
     Oracle Provided Images - 
	Provide a startup script using cloud-init	
	User opc created automatically for Linux instance & Ubuntu for Ubuntu
	Window Update Utility to get latest window updates

     Custom Image (Golden Image)- 
	Create custom image of an instance boot disk and use it to launch other instance
	Instance you launch from custom image include customization configuration and software installed
	During the process instance shut down and remain unavailable, instance restart when process complete
	Custom image do not include the data from any attached block volume
	Custom image cannot exceed 300GB
	Windows custom images cannot be exported or downloaded out of tenancy

     Image Export/Import - 
	Image export import  enable you to share custom image across tenancies and region 
	Image export import uses OCI Object Storage
	Support (Mode you can use when you spun up your instance) - Mode of Import Export
		Emulation Mode - VM IO device CPU & Memory are implemented as software, Emulated VM support almost any X86 OS. These VM are slow
		Para Virtualized - VM include a driver specially designed to enable virtualization
		Native Mode (SR-IOV Single Route IO Virtualzation)- same as Hardware Virtualized Machine (HVM) offers maximum performance with modern OS

     Bring you own image (BYOI)- 
	on prim  > qcow2 image > object Storage > Custom Image <> Instance


  Boot Volume :
	OS Image is store in remote boot volume
	Boot Vol is created automatically and associated with instance until you terminate the instance
	Compute instance can be scaled to a large shape by using boot volumes 
	You can preserve boot volume when you terminate the instance
	Boot volume are only terminated when you manually delete them
	Boot Volume cannot be deattached from running instance
	Possible to take a manual backup, assign backup policy or create clone of boot volume
	
     Custom Boot Volume Size - 
	Linux Boot Volume Size - default 46.6 GB  Custom : 100 GB
	Window Boot Volume Size - default 256 GB  Custom : 500 GB (32 TB)

      Custom Image / Boot Volume Backup (Boot Volume Clone)- 
		Custom Image -
			Export custom image across tenancy or region		Downtime is required
			No cost associated to store Custom Image		Limit of 25 custom image per Compartment
		Boot Volume Backup -
			It doesnt require downtime 				Cost associated with amount of object store used to store backup
			Preserve the entire state of your running OS as backup  Create a boot volume backup while instance is running create a crash consistence backup           


  AutoScaling :
	Running Instance You can create out of that  Config (OS Image, metadata, shape, VNICs, Storage, Subnet)
	Config file use to create  multiple Instance ( 1. Different AD , 2. Manage All together(Stop Start Terminate) , 3. Attach to LB) 
	
     Instance Configuration - 
		Clone an instance and save to a configuration file
		Create standardized baseline instance template
		Easily deploy many instance with CLI from a single config file, 
     Instance Pool - 
		Centrally manage a group of instance workloads that are all configured with a consistence configuration
		Update a large number of instance with a single instance configuration change
		Maintain instance and distribute instance across AD in single region
		Scale out instance on demand by increasing instance size in instance pool
     AutoScaling Configuration -
		AutoScaling  enable you to automatically adjust the number of compute instance in an instance pool based on performance metric CPU & Memory
		Minimum Size, Inital Size,  Maximum Size, Scaling Policy
		When instance pool scale in instance are terminated in this order.
			Number of instance are balanced across AD
			Number of instance are balanced across FD
			Finally within the FD
			oldest instance is terminated
			
	Cooldown Period : Period between two autoscalind period

  Instance Metadata & Life Cycle :
     Instance Metadata - 
	Instance Metadata includes its OCID, name , compartment, shape, region, AD, Creation date, state, image, 
	and any custom metadata as an SSH Public Key
	Service run on every instance and HTTP endpoint listening on 169.254.169.254
	Get instance information by logging into instance and using metadata service
	Add and update custom metadata for an instance using CLI & SDK 
		curl http://169.254.169.254 /opc/v1/instance
		curl http://169.254.169.254 /opc/v1/instance/metadata/
		curl http://169.254.169.254 /opc/v1/instance/metadata/<key name>

     Instance Life Cycle - 
	Resource Billing 
		Standard shape billing pause in stop state
		For other like HPC,GPU,Dense IO continue even stop
	Terminate - 
		Public and Private IP released
		You can preserve boot volume and attach to differnt instance as an data volume or use it to launch a new instance 
		


Block Volume : - 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Local NVMe
	Block Volum
	File Storage
	Object Storage

  Local NVMe :
	Some instance shapes in OCI include locally attached NVMe device
	Locally attached NVMe SSD are not protected and OCI provides no RAID, no Snapshot, no Backup capabilities for these devices
	Customers are responsible for durability of data on Local SSDs

     Protect NVMe SSD Device - 
	RAID 1 - Mirroring - But no parity
	RAID 10 - RAID 1 + RAID 0 - Stripes data across multiple mirrored pairs
	RAID 6 - Block level stripping with two parity blocks distributed accross all member disk
	SLA - for NVMe performance

  Block Volume Intro :
	Store data on block volume independently and Storage servive beyond life span of instance
	You can create attach connect and move volumes as needed to meet your storage and app requirements
	Data is managed as a set of numbered fixed block size (512 ) using protocol such as iSCSI
	Typical Scenarios	
		Persistence and durable storage
		expand an instance storage
		instane scaling 
	
	Basic - 		iops/gb 2     iops/volume 3k	throughputGB 240 (No VPU : Volume performance unit)
	Balanced		iops/gb 60    iops/volume 25k	throughputGB 480
	High performance	iops/gb 75    iops/volume 35k	throughputGB 600


     Creating and Attaching Vol.-
	Attach your block volume - 1. Paravirtulaized	2. ISCSI
	By default all Block Volume is read/write

     Deatching & Deleting Block Vol. -
	When instance no longer require block volume, You can disconnect and then attach it from the instance without loss of data.	
	When you attach same vol. to another instance or to the same instance DO NOT FORMAT
	when volume itself no longer needed you can delete block volume, And you cannot undo delete operation
     
     Block Volume offline resize -
	Expand an existing volume in place with offline resizing (cannot resize an attached vol.)
	Restore from a volume backup to a larger vol.
	Clone a existing volume to new larger vol.
	You can only increase size of the volume , You cannot decrease size of vol.	


  Block Volume Demo :
	Consistence device path - If you are rebooting your instance and you want your block volume to mount automatically its good idea to use Consistence device path
	Attachment Type 
		ISCSI - Need to run commands to attach volume
		ParaVirtualized - It automatically take care of attaching the volume as if its run locally (drawback : Little bit performance down)
	Block Volumn performance tier can be changed dynamically (Basic > Balanced > High Performance)
		1. Create Block volume from console
		2. Run iscsi discovery and attach command after logging into Server
		3. Create partition sudo fdisk -l /dev/oracleoci/oraclevdb		
		4. Create file system sudo mkfs -t ext4 /dev/oracleoci/oraclevdb		


  Backup and Restoration :
	Complete point-in-time snapshot copy of your block volume
	Encrypted and stored in Object Storage service and can be restored as new volumes to any AD within the same region
	Can copy block volume backup from one region to another 
	Backup is performed in backend async. Your application can continue to access your data
	Two Kind of Backups
		On-Demand One-Off-Volume Backup >  full & Incremental
		Policy based backup - 
			Bronze - Monthly(11 months) Yearly (5 Year)
			Silver - Weekly(4 Weeks) Monthly(11 months) Yearly (5 Year)
			Gold - Daily(A Week) Weekly(4 Weeks) Monthly(11 months) Yearly (5 Year)
	Customized backup policy not supported

  Clone & Volume Group : 
     Clone -
	Clone allows copying an entire existing block volume to a new volume without needing to go through a backup and restore process
	Clone is point in time direct disk - to - disk deep copy of an entire volume
	Clone operation is immediate but actual copying data is in background 15 mins for 1TB
	A clone can only be created in same AD with no need of detaching the source volume before cloning it.
	Clone cannot be copied to another region
	A clone can be attached and used as a regular volume when it lifescycle state changes from "PROVISIONING" to "AVAILABLE"
	Clone and Backup are mutually exclusive
	Number of clones created simultaneously
		Volume is attached - one clone at a time
		Volume is deattached - 10 clone at a time
			
     Volume Group - 
	Group together block and boot volume from multiple compartment across multiple compute instance in a volume group
	You can use volume group to create volume group backup and clone that are point in time and crash consistence
	Manually trigger a full or incremental backup of all volume in a volume group leverging a co-ordinated snapshot across region
	Volume group features available free of charge 	


  Boot Volume: 
	A compute instance is launched using OS image stored on a remote boot volume
	Boot volume is created and assoicated with instane until you terminate instance
	Launch another intance with a boot volume -
		First create custom image of boot volume and then using custom image launch instane
		alternately you can launch new instance directly from unattached boot volume if you dont with to create custom image 
	Delete boot volume -
		You can delete an unattached boot volume
		you can opionally choose to automatically delete boot volume during time of termination of instance
		OCI does not allow you to delete the boot volume currently attach to instance
	Possible to take manual backup, assigned backup policy or create clone of boot volume 
	You can attach boot volume to instance as block storage in order to debug issue.
	
     Custom Boot Volume
	You have option to specifying a custom boot volume size
	In order to take advantage of larger size you need to first extend root or system partition 
		Linux - 46.6 GB
		Window - 256 GB


File Storage : - 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  File Storage Intro: 
	Use Case
		EBS, HPC, General purpose file system, Big Data & Analytics, MicroService Container

     File Storage Service Feature - 
	AD-local service available in all OCI Region and AD
	Support NFS v.3
	Network Lock Management (NLM) for file locking 
	Full POSIX semantics
	Data protection : Snapshot capabilities 10,000 snapshot per file sytsem
	Security 128 bit, Data at rest encryption for all file system and metadata
	Console,API,CLI,Terraform, and Data path commands
	Create 100 file system and 2 mount target per AD per Account		
	
     Mount Target - 
	NFS endpoint that lives in your subnet of choice ; AD-Specfic
	Mount target has an IP addr and DNS name that you use in your mount command
	Require 3 private IP addr in subnet (dont use /30 for smaller subnet for FSS)	
	Two IP is used during mount target creation ; 3rd IP used for HA 
	Placing NFS client an dMount Target in same subnet can result in IP conflicts as users not shown which private ip are used for mount target
	Place FSS mount target in its own subnet where it can consume ip as it needed
	
     File System - 
	Primary source of storing files in FSS
	To access file system you create a new or use existing mount target
	100 file system per mount target
	AD-Specific
	Acccessible from OCI VM/BM
	Accessible from on prem though VPN/FastConnect

     Export Path - 
	Export path make file system available through mount target. 
	It is unique path specified when the file system associated with mount target
	No two file system associate with same mount target can have overlapping export parth	
	Eg /example & /example/path not allowed 
	Export path along with mount target ip address is used to mount the file system to an instance
		#sudo mount 10.0.0.6//example1/path /mnt/mountA

     Mounting an OCI File System- 
	Launch OCI instance from Console
	Use NFS V3 protocol to mount the FSS volume
	install nfs-util (Linux) nfs-common(Ubuntu)
	Create a directory
	on FFS console click on Mount Targets
	Use private ip address information to mount volume using nfs command


  File Storage Demo :  
	

	Create File System (File System create Mount Targets )
	So Create first Mount Target
	File system and Mount Target are AD Specific
	We identitfy mount target with IP addr
	That IP Address along with Export Path is the way we expose file system
	Configure security list on mount target to allow traffic (because IP is on mount target)
	We need to open statefull ingress TCP Port - 111 2048-2050
					  UDP Port - 111 2048
					
			          egress TCP Port - 111 2048-2050
					  UDP Port -111   (This port configured to TCP Connection to  servive reboot)
					
	File System > Export Path (to get NFS Commands from console


  File Storage Security :  
     Security - 
	Four distinct and seperate layer of security
		IAM Service - Create an instance (NFS Clinet) and FSS VCN	
 		Security List - Connection NFS Client to Mount Target 
		Export Option - Applying access control list per file system based on source ip cidr block that birdge the SL  and NFS V3 unix security layer 
		NFS V3. Unix Security  -
	
     NFS Export Option-
	Security list is all or nothing option - the client either can or cannot access mount target 
	In multi tenant env using NFS Export option you can limit client ability to conect to file system and view or write data
	When you create file system and associated mount target the NFS export option for that file system set to allow full access to all NFS client
		Source - 0.0.0.0/0 
		Require Privilege Source Port - False	
		Access - Read_Write
		Identity Squash - None
		
  File Storage Service Snapshot : 	 
	Snapshot provides a read only, space efficient, point in time backup of file system
	Snapshot is created under root folder of file system in a hidden directory named .snapshot	
	You can take upto 10K snaphsot
	
	

Object Storage : -

    Securing ADB :
	Store all data in encrypted format. Only authenticated user and application can access data.
	Database client uses SSL/TLS 1.2 and mutual authenticated connetion
	Certificate based authenication uses encryption key stored in walled on both client adn service side.
	You can speify specific ip range to access ADB using access control file
	
    TroubleShooting Connectivity Issue :
	Ensure Access Control List for ADB has necessary entries of CIDR block range of IPs
	When connecting from client behind firewall make sure your firewall must allow access to server within .oraclecloud.com using TCP port 1522
	When conection from client running in private subnet make sure service gateway or NAT Gateway attach to VCN , Route Table has correct entry rule 
	for Service gateway or NAT Gateway, Security List need to have proper egress rule
	When conection from client running in public subnet ensure internet gateway attach to VCN and route table and SL are configured correctly
